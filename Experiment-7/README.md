# Experiment 7

## Examples

### Example 1

Create a model that generates a sine wave and then integrate it to explore what the output looks like when a sine wave is integrated.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Create a model that generates a Pulse wave with a period of $5$ sec and $30\%$ of period as pulse width and then integrate it to explore what the output looks like when a Pulse wave is integrated.

### Exercise 2

Create a model that generates a Sine wave with a Frequency $3$ rad/sec and then differentiate it to explore what the output looks like when a Sine wave is differentiated. [Hint: for differentiator go to Simulink > Continuous > Derivative].

### Exercise 3

Create a model that generates a Pulse wave with a period of $5$ sec and $30\%$ of period as pulse width and then differentiate it to explore what the output looks like when a Pulse wave is differentiated.
